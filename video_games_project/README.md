This dataset is from Yandex Praktikum data-analyst course I was taking in 2021/2021.

Dataset contains data about video game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms from 1980 to 2016. What I've been doing:

The project includes the following steps:
 - cleaning and preprocessing data (droping duplicated, filling missing data)
 - identifying the patterns that determine the success of the game
 - creating a portrait of the user of each region
 - statistical hypothesis testing
 - making plots

Using:
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - numpy
