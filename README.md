# Shayakhmetova Irina - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About me <a name="about_me"></a>
  
  Hi, I'm Irina. In the past I studied philosophy in Moscow State Universty(B.S.) and worked as a Supply Manager in Travel Tech company. However, after that I decided to start learning Data Analysis, because I always liked math, statistics and finding insites about products and user's behavior. In 2021/2022 I took a Yandex.Practicum course and got new skills like SQL and Python. 
  
I've created this repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.
